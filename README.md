## React Fundamental Concepts Used

- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: Used to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, making it easier to define the UI structure.

- **Components**: The application is built using reusable functional components that encapsulate specific parts of the UI.

- **State Management (`useState`)**: Utilized to manage local state within components, allowing for dynamic updates based on user interactions.

- **Effect Hook (`useEffect`)**: Employed to handle side effects such as fetching data from APIs and updating the UI based on dependencies.

- **Context API**: Implemented to manage global state and share data across multiple components without prop drilling.

- **Event Handling**: Reactâ€™s synthetic event system is used to manage user interactions, such as clicks and form submissions.

- **React Router**: Enables navigation between different pages for a single-page application (SPA) experience, allowing users to navigate without full page reloads.

- **`useNavigate`**: Facilitates programmatic navigation, allowing components to redirect users based on actions (e.g., after form submission).

- **`useParams`**: Extracts URL parameters for rendering dynamic content, such as detailed information about gadgets.

- **`NavLink`**: Creates navigation links with automatic active styling, improving the navigation experience and indicating the current page.

## Data Management

I have used Context API for managing global state across components, enabling seamless data sharing without prop drilling. This approach helps maintain a consistent state throughout the application, particularly for user preferences and selected gadgets.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Gadget Listings**: Users can browse a curated collection of gadgets organized by categories, each with detailed specifications.

2. **Favorite Management**: Users can tap the heart icon to save gadgets to a favorites list for easy access and comparison later.

3. **Detailed Views**: Each gadget has a dedicated page displaying comprehensive information, including images, descriptions, and specifications.

4. **Intuitive Navigation**: The application features a user-friendly navigation system with NavLink, making it easy for users to access different sections and enhancing their overall experience.

5. **Purchase Functionality**: Users can easily add gadgets to their cart and proceed to checkout, streamlining the purchasing process directly through the app.
